				<h2>Course Contract</h2>
		</header>

		<main>

				<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Thinh Pham</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring WEB250-N890 Database Driven Websites course with my instructor, DI von Briesen.</p>

				<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
 
				<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

				<p>Signed: Thinh Pham, January 13, 2021</p>
